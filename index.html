            It is a historical site.
            <strong>Navratna Fort of Raja Bhoj</strong> is located here due to
            which , the name of the village is called <em>Naya Bhojpur</em>.It
            is known from the pages of history that the fort was built in 1633
            by King Rudra Pratap Narayan Singh.It is famous for that there were
            52 streets and 56 markets inside the fort.Unfortunately,the Mughal
            ruler caught sight of it and within 3 years , Mughal Subedar
            Abdullah Khan of Bihar demolished it.Later Baimat khan, son of Syed
            Khan of Mughal Rule, came to Bhojpur as Shahi Alamdar.He named
            Bhojpur as Shahabad.After 1764, when the British rule occupied this
            area, Shahabad district was formed on the basis of the same
            name.Today there are four parts Ara,Buxar,Sasaram and Bhabhua.Whem
            Shahabad was divided, Bhojpur and now Bhojpur district is known as
            Ara.This is the glorious history of Buxar district.
